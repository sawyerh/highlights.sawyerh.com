People who are well read (aka not dumb) read a lot. They don't have time to
wade through jargon. They want the information else quickly and easily –
just like everyone else. Wanting to understand quickly has little to do
with intelligence. It has a lot to do with time and respect.

Filling web pages with turgid prose doesn't make anyone look clever; it
makes them look arrogant and disrespectful. They don't care what people
think of the writing or how long it takes the audience to get through it.

Crits.

The rules are: be respectful, everyone did the best job possible with the
knowledge they had at the time. Only discuss the content, not the person
who created it. Only give constructive criticism: "That's crap" is
unhelpful and unacceptable. No one has to defend a decision.
