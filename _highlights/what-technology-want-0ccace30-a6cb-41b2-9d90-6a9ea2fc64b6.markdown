The ever-thickening mix of existing technologies in a society creates a supersaturated matrix charged with restless potential. When the right idea is seeded within, the inevitable invention practically explodes into existence, like an ice crystal freezing out of water.

The path of freezing water is predetermined, but there is great leeway, freedom, and beauty in the individual expression of its predestined state.
