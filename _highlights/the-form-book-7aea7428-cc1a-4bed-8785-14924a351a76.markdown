Communication forms serve to send information in one direction only: from
the provider to the user. The provider creates the form, fills it with
information, and passes it on to the user, who reads the content and acts
accordingly. Examples are invoices, receipts, notices statements and
records

Dialogue forms go a step further. The provider creates a form with blank
spaces which is passed on to the user. This too is a kind of information,
since it is a request for the form to be filled in, the object being to
obtain information from the user in the manner specified by the form. The
user inserts the information, and returns it to the provider for
evaluation, thereby reversing the roles: the user becomes the sender, and
the provider becomes the receiver. Thus the form initiates a dialogue.
Examples of this type of form include applications, order forms and
questionnaires.

Internal forms include such items as time sheets, expenses forms and sick
notes. Their main function is organizational and they reflect internal
divisions of labour. External forms include applications, contracts and
invoices. They permit interaction and exchanges of information between
provider and user, and as well as being efficient tools of the trade, they
are also a means for providers to present themselves to the outside world.
