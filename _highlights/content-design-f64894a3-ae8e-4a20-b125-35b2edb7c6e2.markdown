The way you do bulleted lists is a matter of style. Generally I'd go with:
if it has a lead-in sentence, use lowercase at the start of each of the
bullet points. If there's no lead-in, uppercase. Punctuation at the end of
a sentence is entirely optional. Screen readers (software products designed
to help people with visual impairments read digital content) will pause
longer if there is a comma at the end of each point. That's about it,
though.
