In order for forms to fullfill their organizational role, their content and
design must fit in with the work procedures of the provider. However, this
is a two-way process, since procedures may also be influenced by forms, and
so herein lies one key to appropriate design: forms are always
simultaneously a mirror of internal organization and an instrument that can
change and/or optimize that organization.

Designing forms is therefore not just a matter of giving administrative
processes a visual form but changing the processes themselves. The two
actions cannot take place independently of each other, however. The aim is
always to produce forms that will facilitate effective interaction with
users and will create the best possible organizational structure for the
provider's working practices. But since these are generally established
before the forms are created, the conditions required for successful
interaction, such as clarity and user friendliness, are often neglected.
