The other thing to say about the utopian idea is that it lives in the
Valley partly as a marketing strategy. This is a political operation of the
first importance. If the Valley can convince Washington that the Valley is
the home of the future and that its leaders see things that leaders back in
stuffy old DC can’t see, then they can also make a case for being
deregulated.

Why regulate the future? Who wants to do that?

So, it’s very tactical. Claiming the high ground of the utopian future is a
very tactical claim.
