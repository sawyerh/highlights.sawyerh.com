Many providers use forms to communicate with the outside world even if they
have never actually devoted much attention to their corporate identity.
Indeed, without forms they would scarcely be able to function. Each one not
only conveys essential information but also reveals something about the
identity of the provider -- in other words whether intentionally or
unintentionally, each form influences the public image of the particular
company or authority. And it can happen all too easily that the image
conveyed is nothing like the image the provider wishes to convey. It is
therefore in the interests of all concerned that providers focus more
closely on corporate identity issues and include forms as part of this.
