Job stories are a better choice if you only have one audience to deal with.
You know you need to switch from user stories to job stories if every
single user story you write begins with the same thing. If you're writing
'As a shopper, I...' at the beginning of every user story, switch to job
stories.

If you have multiple audiences, each of which has different needs for
different kinds of content and different levels of detail, you may find
user stories better.
