Forms are based on the assumption that they are absolutely necessary. It
would contradict the whole concept of the form if the same end could be
achieved by filling in a different form or even doing without one
altogether. There is nothing vague and there are no maybes. Only yes or no,
valid or invalid, true or false. And yet many forms appear to be
interchangeable and arbitrary both in their design and in the information
they request.
