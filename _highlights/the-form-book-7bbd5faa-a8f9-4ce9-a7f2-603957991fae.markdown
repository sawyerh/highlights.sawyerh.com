Wherever we go, forms go with us. Without them, there are no orders,
payments, deliveries, marriages, divorces, immigrations, emigrations, tax
declarations, arrest warrants or sick notes. They are there from the moment
we're born, and we're not even allowed to die without them. They bring
order, or at least form in the most literal sense, into our lives; they
promise clarity and direction, yet so often they cause helplessness, chaos
and confusion. A challenge to designers, they are sometimes sadly neglected
as they attempt to start a silent dialogue with the people who, frequently
put off by the very sight of them reluctantly have to fill them in.
