I've found the best way to get the rest of an organisation to agree with my
work and approach is to run a workshop where all the right people are
together.

My advice is to invite anyone and everyone who might influence, stop or
change your content.

Get the fact-checkers, the lawyers, the bosses – anyone who might feel the
need to interfere.
