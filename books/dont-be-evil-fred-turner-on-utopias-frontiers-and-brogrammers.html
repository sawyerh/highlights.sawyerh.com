    I want to say one more thing about politics.

One of the legacies of the counterculture, particularly on the left, is the
idea that expression is action. This idea has haunted those of us on the
left for a long time.

But one of the reasons that the Tea Party came to power was that they
organized—they built institutions. So the challenge for those of us who
want a different world is not to simply trust that the expressive variety
that the internet permits is the key to freedom. Rather, we need to seek a
kind of freedom that involves people not like us, that builds institutions
that support people not like us—not just ones that help gratify our desires
to find new partners or build better micro-worlds.

The New Communalists believed that the micro-world was where politics
happened. If we could just build a better micro-world, we could live by
example to create a better world for the whole. I think that's wrong. Our
challenge is to build a world that takes responsibility for people not like
ourselves. And it's a challenge we won't meet by enhancing our expressive
abilities, or improving the technologies of expressive connection.

    When you take away bureaucracy and hierarchy and politics, you take away
the ability to negotiate the distribution of resources on explicit terms.
And you replace it with charisma, with cool, with shared but unspoken
perceptions of power. You replace it with the cultural forces that guide
our behavior in the absence of rules.

    The other thing to say about the utopian idea is that it lives in the
Valley partly as a marketing strategy. This is a political operation of the
first importance. If the Valley can convince Washington that the Valley is
the home of the future and that its leaders see things that leaders back in
stuffy old DC can’t see, then they can also make a case for being
deregulated.

Why regulate the future? Who wants to do that?

So, it’s very tactical. Claiming the high ground of the utopian future is a
very tactical claim.

    Engineers try to do politics by changing infrastructure.

That’s what they do. They tweak infrastructure. It’s a little bit like an
ancient Roman trying to shape public debate by reconfiguring the Forum.
“We’ll have seven new entrances instead of six, and the debate will change.”

The engineering world doesn’t have a conception of how to intervene in
debate that isn’t infrastructural.

    What are the “politics of infrastructure"? What does that phrase mean?

It means several different things. First, it involves the recognition that
the built environment, whether it's built out of tarmac or concrete or
code, has political effects. I was joking earlier about reshaping the
Forum, but I shouldn't have joked quite so much, because the fact that the
Forum was round encouraged one kind of debate.

Think about an auditorium where someone sits onstage and the audience
watches, versus a Quaker meeting where everyone sits in a circle. They're
very different.

So, structure matters. Design is absolutely critical. Design is the process
by which the politics of one world become the constraints on another. How
are those constraints built? What are its effects on political life?

To study the politics of infrastructure is to study the political ideas
that get built into the design process, and the infrastructure’s impact on
the political possibilities of the communities that engage it.
