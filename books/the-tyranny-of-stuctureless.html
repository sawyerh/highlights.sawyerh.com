    <p>Contrary to what we would like to believe, there is no such thing as a
structureless group. Any group of people of whatever nature that comes
together for any length of time for any purpose will inevitably structure
itself in some fashion. The structure may be flexible; it may vary over
time; it may evenly or unevenly distribute tasks, power and resources over
the members of the group. But it will be formed regardless of the
abilities, personalities, or intentions of the people involved. The very
fact that we are individuals, with different talents, predispositions, and
backgrounds makes this inevitable.</p>

    <p>Because elites are informal does not mean they are invisible. At any small
group meeting anyone with a sharp eye and an acute ear can tell who is
influencing whom. The members of a friendship group will relate more to
each other than to other people. They listen more attentively, and
interrupt less; they repeat each other’s points and give in amiably; they
tend to ignore or grapple with the “outs” whose approval is not necessary
for making a decision.</p>

    <p>Diffusion of information to everyone as frequently as possible. Information
is power. Access to information enhances one’s power. When an informal
network spreads new ideas and information among themselves outside the
group, they are already engaged in the process of forming an opinion –
without the group participating. The more one knows about how things work
and what is happening, the more politically effective one can be.</p>

    <p>because there are no official spokespeople nor any decision-making body
that the press can query when it wants to know the movement’s position on a
subject, these women are perceived as the spokespeople. Thus, whether they
want to or not, whether the movement likes it or not, women of public note
are put in the role of spokespeople by default.
This is one main source of the ire that is often felt toward the women who
are labeled “stars.” Because they were not selected by the women in the
movement to represent the movement’s views, they are resented when the
press presumes that they speak for the movement. But as long as the
movement does not select its own spokeswomen, such women will be placed in
that role by the press and the public, regardless of their own desires.</p>

    <p>structurelessness becomes a way of masking power, and within the women’s
movement is usually most strongly advocated by those who are the most
powerful (whether they are conscious of their power or not). As long as the
structure of the group is informal, the rules of how decisions are made are
known only to a few and awareness of power is limited to those who know the
rules. Those who do not know the rules and are not chosen for initiation
must remain in confusion, or suffer from paranoid delusions that something
is happening of which they are not quite aware.</p>

    <p>For everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in a given group and to
participate in its activities the structure must be explicit, not implicit.
The rules of decision-making must be open and available to everyone, and
this can happen only if they are formalized. This is not to say that
formalization of a structure of a group will destroy the informal
structure. It usually doesn’t. But it does hinder the informal structure
from having predominant control and make available some means of attacking
it if the people involved are not at least responsible to the needs of the
group at large. “Structurelessness” is organizationally impossible. We
cannot decide whether to have a structured or structureless group, only
whether or not to have a formally structured one.</p>

    <p>If the movement continues deliberately to not select who shall exercise
power, it does not thereby abolish power. All it does is abdicate the right
to demand that those who do exercise power and influence be responsible for
it. If the movement continues to keep power as diffuse as possible because
it knows it cannot demand responsibility from those who have it, it does
prevent any group or person from totally dominating. But it simultaneously
insures that the movement is as ineffective as possible. Some middle ground
between domination and ineffectiveness can and must be found.</p>

    <p>Rotation of tasks among individuals. Responsibilities which are held too
long by one person, formally or informally, come to be seen as that
person’s “property” and are not easily relinquished or controlled by the
group. Conversely, if tasks are rotated too frequently the individual does
not have time to learn her job well and acquire the sense of satisfaction
of doing a good job.</p>

This prevents monopoly of power and requires those in positions of
authority to consult with many others in the process of exercising it. It
also gives many people the opportunity to have responsibility for specific
tasks and thereby to learn different skills.</p>
