    <p>80/20 rule</p>

<p>So, with your research and your user needs, you know what is important for
your audience. With that in mind you can put what most people are looking
for right up front. This is the 80/20 rule. Put the information that 80% of
your audience is looking for first. The information the other 20% of your
audience is looking for should be there – and findable from a search engine
– but not front and centre. It will put off 80% of your audience.</p>

    <p>People who are well read (aka not dumb) read a lot. They don’t have time to
wade through jargon. They want the information else quickly and easily –
just like everyone else. Wanting to understand quickly has little to do
with intelligence. It has a lot to do with time and respect.</p>

<p>Filling web pages with turgid prose doesn’t make anyone look clever; it
makes them look arrogant and disrespectful. They don’t care what people
think of the writing or how long it takes the audience to get through it.</p>

<p>Crits.</p>

<p>The rules are: be respectful, everyone did the best job possible with the
knowledge they had at the time. Only discuss the content, not the person
who created it. Only give constructive criticism: “That’s crap” is
unhelpful and unacceptable. No one has to defend a decision.</p>

    <p>Job stories are a better choice if you only have one audience to deal with.
You know you need to switch from user stories to job stories if every
single user story you write begins with the same thing. If you’re writing
‘As a shopper, I…’ at the beginning of every user story, switch to job
stories.</p>

<p>If you have multiple audiences, each of which has different needs for
different kinds of content and different levels of detail, you may find
user stories better.</p>

easy. Some don’t want their audience to engage – which in the digital age

    <p>The Oxford Guide to Plain English recommends words per sentence. It also
says: ‘If you regularly exceed 40 words, you’ll certainly weary and deter
your readers’</p>

<p>Jyoti Sanyal, author of Indlish (the book for every English-speaking
Indian), said: ‘Based on several studies, press associations in the USA
have laid down a readability table. Their survey shows readers find
sentences of 8 words or less very easy to read; 11 words, easy; 14 words
fairly easy; 17 words standard; 21 words fairly difficult; 25 words
difficult and 29 words or more, very difficult.’</p>

<p>Author Ann Wylie said: ‘When the average sentence length in a piece was
fewer than 8 words long, readers understood 100% of the story. At 14 words,
they could comprehend more than 90% of the information. But move up to
43-word sentences and comprehension dropped below 10 percent.’</p>

<p>This will stand out in people’s email inboxes. It sounds final and it has
an action attached. People in places of authority or responsibility either
love, or are scared of decisions. Either way, you probably have their
attention. It also sends a clear message to those people. They: are
expected to make a decision, may feel they’ll miss something important if
they are not there, and are much more likely to open that email.</p>

    <p>The way you do bulleted lists is a matter of style. Generally I’d go with:
if it has a lead-in sentence, use lowercase at the start of each of the
bullet points. If there’s no lead-in, uppercase. Punctuation at the end of
a sentence is entirely optional. Screen readers (software products designed
to help people with visual impairments read digital content) will pause
longer if there is a comma at the end of each point. That’s about it,
though.</p>

    <p>There’s a book called ‘Information Foraging Theory’ written by Peter L T
Pirolli, published in 2007. Despite its age, it’s an mine of information
that is mostly still relevant today. In short (I’m reducing 216 pages to a
sentence here), it says that users will go as far as they need to, and
click as many times as they need to, as long as the scent of information’
is strong.</p>

<p>In other words: as long as a person thinks they will get the information
they need, and they don’t think they are on the wrong path, they will
continue for quite some time.</p>

<p>You can use this for structuring the information on your website, in-page
copy, and tools and transactions. As long as you follow your audience’s
mental model of how the information will be available, and you provide a
strong scent of information, you are on the right path.</p>

<p>That’s not an excuse to be verbose. What I’m saying is: people don’t always
abandon a task within a set number of clicks.</p>
