    <p>In his book Where Good Ideas Come From, he explores an idea called “the adjacent possible”: At every moment in the timeline of an expanding biosphere, there are doors that cannot be unlocked yet. In human culture, we like to think of breakthrough ideas as sudden accelerations on the timeline, where a genius jumps ahead fifty years and invents something that normal minds, trapped in the present moment, couldn’t possibly have come up with. But the truth is that technological (and scientific) advances rarely break out of the adjacent possible; the history of cultural progress is, almost without exception, a story of one door leading to another door, exploring the palace one room at a time.</p>

    <p>Design layouts and systems that can cope to whatever environment they may find themselves in. But the only way we can do any of this is to shed ways of thinking that have been shackles around our necks. They’re holding us back. Start designing from the content out, rather than the canvas in. This content-out way of thinking is fundamentally different to the canvas-in approach that dates all the way back to the Book of Kells. It asks web designers to give up the illusion of control and create a materially-honest discipline for the World Wide Web.</p>

    <p>XHTML 2.0 died on the vine. Its theoretical purity was roundly rejected by the people who actually made websites for a living. Web designers rightly refused to publish in a format that would fail completely instead of trying to recover from an error. Strange then, that years later, web designers would happily create entire websites using JavaScript, a language that shares XML’s unforgiving error-handling model. They didn’t call them websites. They called them web apps. That distinction was cold comfort to someone who couldn’t complete their task because a service relied on JavaScript for crucial functionality.</p>

    <p>In his classic book How Buildings Learn Stewart Brand highlights an idea by the British architect Frank Duffy: A building properly conceived is several layers of longevity. Duffy called these shearing layers. Each of the layers moves at a different timescale. Brand expanded on the idea, proposing six alliterative layers: Site— the physical location of a building only changes on a geological timescale. Structure— the building itself can last for centuries. Skin— the exterior surface gets a facelift or a new lick of paint every few decades. Services— the plumbing and wiring need to be updated every ten years or so. Space plan— the layout of walls and doors might change occasionally. Stuff— the arrangement of furniture in a room can change on a daily basis.</p>

    <p>The idea of shearing layers can also be applied to our creations on the web. Our domain names are the geological sites upon which we build. At the other end of the timescale, content on the web— the “stuff”— can be added and updated by the hour, the minute, or even the second. In between are the layers of structure, presentation, and behaviour: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
