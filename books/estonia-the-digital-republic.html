    Estonian folklore includes a creature known as the kratt: an assembly of
random objects that the Devil will bring to life for you, in exchange for a
drop of blood offered at the conjunction of five roads. The Devil gives the
kratt a soul, making it the slave of its creator.

“Each and every Estonian, even children, understands this character,”
Kaevats said. His office now speaks of kratt instead of robots and
algorithms, and has been using the word to define a new, important nuance
in Estonian law. “Basically, a kratt is a robot with representative
rights,” he explained. “The idea that an algorithm can buy and sell
services on your behalf is a conceptual upgrade.” In the U.S., where we
lack such a distinction, it’s a matter of dispute whether, for instance,
Facebook is responsible for algorithmic sales to Russian forces of
misinformation. #KrattLaw—Estonia’s digital shorthand for a new category of
legal entity comprising A.I., algorithms, and robots—will make it possible
to hold accountable whoever gave a drop of blood.

    In Tallinn’s courtrooms, judges’ benches are fitted with two monitors, for
consulting information during the proceedings, and case files are assembled
according to the once-only principle. The police make reports directly into
the system; forensic specialists at the scene or in the lab do likewise.
Lawyers log on—as do judges, prison wardens, plaintiffs, and defendants,
each through his or her portal. The Estonian courts used to be notoriously
backlogged, but that is no longer the case.

“No one was able to say whether we should increase the number of courts or
increase the number of judges,” Timo Mitt, a manager at Netgroup, which the
government hired to build the architecture, told me. Digitizing both
streamlined the process and helped identify points of delay. Instead of
setting up prisoner transport to trial—fraught with security risks—Estonian
courts can teleconference defendants into the courtroom from prison.

    A tenet of the Estonian system is that an individual owns all information
recorded about him or her. Every time a doctor (or a border guard, a police
officer, a banker, or a minister) glances at any of Piperal’s secure data
online, that look is recorded and reported. Peeping at another person’s
secure data for no reason is a criminal offense. “In Estonia, we don’t have
Big Brother; we have Little Brother,” a local told me. “You can tell him
what to do and maybe also beat him up.”

    “If everything is digital, and location-independent, you can run a
borderless country,” Kotka said. In 2014, the government launched a digital
“residency” program, which allows logged-in foreigners to partake of some
Estonian services, such as banking, as if they were living in the country.
Other measures encourage international startups to put down virtual roots;
Estonia has the lowest business-tax rates in the European Union, and has
become known for liberal regulations around tech research. It is legal to
test Level 3 driverless cars (in which a human driver can take control) on
all Estonian roads, and the country is planning ahead for Level 5 (cars
that take off on their own). “We believe that innovation happens anyway,”
Viljar Lubi, Estonia’s deputy secretary for economic development, says. “If
we close ourselves off, the innovation happens somewhere else.”

    I asked Kaevats what he saw when he looked at the U.S. Two things, he said.
First, a technical mess. Data architecture was too centralized. Citizens
didn’t control their own data; it was sold, instead, by brokers. Basic
security was lax. “For example, I can tell you my I.D. number—I don’t
fucking care,” he said. “You have a Social Security number, which is, like,
a big secret.” He laughed. “This does not work!” The U.S. had backward
notions of protection, he said, and the result was a bigger problem: a
systemic loss of community and trust. “Snowden things and whatnot have done
a lot of damage. But they have also proved that these fears are justified.

“To regain this trust takes quite a lot of time,” he went on. “There also
needs to be a vision from the political side. It needs to be there always—a
policy, not politics. But the politicians need to live it, because, in
today’s world, everything will be public at some point.”

    Finding the business interests of the rich and powerful—a hefty field of
journalism in the United States—takes a moment’s research, because every
business connection or investment captured in any record in Estonia becomes
searchable public information. (An online tool even lets citizens map webs
of connection, follow-the-money style.) Traffic stops are illegal in the
absence of a moving violation, because officers acquire records from a
license-plate scan. Polling-place intimidation is a non-issue if people can
vote—and then change their votes, up to the deadline—at home, online. And
heat is taken off immigration because, in a borderless society, a resident
need not even have visited Estonia in order to work and pay taxes under its
dominion.

    Data aren’t centrally held, thus reducing the chance of Equifax-level
breaches. Instead, the government’s data platform, X-Road, links individual
servers through end-to-end encrypted pathways, letting information live
locally. Your dentist’s practice holds its own data; so does your high
school and your bank. When a user requests a piece of information, it is
delivered like a boat crossing a canal via locks.

Although X-Road is a government platform, it has become, owing to its
ubiquity, the network that many major private firms build on, too. Finland,
Estonia’s neighbor to the north, recently began using X-Road, which means
that certain data—for instance, prescriptions that you’re able to pick up
at a local pharmacy—can be linked between the nations. It is easy to
imagine a novel internationalism taking shape in this form.

    It struck me then how long it had been since anyone in America had spoken
of society-building of any kind. It was as if, in the nineties, Estonia and
the U.S. had approached a fork in the road to a digital future, and the
U.S. had taken one path—personalization, anonymity, information
privatization, and competitive efficiency—while Estonia had taken the
other. Two decades on, these roads have led to distinct places, not just in
digital culture but in public life as well.

    Today, the old fatuities of the nation-state are showing signs of crisis.
Formerly imperialist powers have withered into nationalism (as in Brexit)
and separatism (Scotland, Catalonia). New powers, such as the Islamic
State, have redefined nationhood by ideological acculturation. It is
possible to imagine a future in which nationality is determined not so much
by where you live as by what you log on to.

    Today, citizens can vote from their laptops and challenge parking tickets
from home. They do so through the “once only” policy, which dictates that
no single piece of information should be entered twice. Instead of having
to “prepare” a loan application, applicants have their data—income, debt,
savings—pulled from elsewhere in the system. There’s nothing to fill out in
doctors’ waiting rooms, because physicians can access their patients’
medical histories. Estonia’s system is keyed to a chip-I.D. card that
reduces typically onerous, integrative processes—such as doing taxes—to
quick work.
