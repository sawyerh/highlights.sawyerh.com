    <p>Forms are based on the assumption that they are absolutely necessary. It
would contradict the whole concept of the form if the same end could be
achieved by filling in a different form or even doing without one
altogether. There is nothing vague and there are no maybes. Only yes or no,
valid or invalid, true or false. And yet many forms appear to be
interchangeable and arbitrary both in their design and in the information
they request.</p>

    <p>Many providers use forms to communicate with the outside world even if they
have never actually devoted much attention to their corporate identity.
Indeed, without forms they would scarcely be able to function. Each one not
only conveys essential information but also reveals something about the
identity of the provider – in other words whether intentionally or
unintentionally, each form influences the public image of the particular
company or authority. And it can happen all too easily that the image
conveyed is nothing like the image the provider wishes to convey. It is
therefore in the interests of all concerned that providers focus more
closely on corporate identity issues and include forms as part of this.</p>

<p>Why certain questions are asked, and what happens to the information is
often unclear to users, and so they cannot foresee the consequences of
their own actions. By filling in the form, they are therefore taking a
potential risk. They see themselves confronted by a bureaucracy that is a
kind of ‘black box’ system whose workings cannot be seen, and so they feel
vulnerable and oppressed.</p>

<p>Forms can be hard to understand and off-putting in both language and
design. Often it is not clear what information is supposed to be supplied
and where it should go. Questions are easily misconstrued, terms and
explanations can be contradictory and hard to read, and there may be too
many pages to take in. Users are left feeling frustrated and disorientated.</p>

    <p>Good design is not a panacea, and should not be merely cosmetic. Nothing is
more disheartening than a harmless, friendly-looking form whose content
turns out to be the direct opposite. The fact that tax return forms look so
complicated is primarily because the tax system is complicated, and paying
taxes can’t be made more pleasant just by making the forms look good.
Hiding things away or sprucing them up will not help, but a clearly
laid-out and easy-to-read design may at least soften the blow.</p>

<p>In a demanding context, form design has to cope with many obstacles. It
always reflects pre-existing structures, and in so doing it often brings to
light flaws that can only be rectified by reorganization. But changing
existing systems - personal, material or technical - is often very
expensive and is liable to meet with strong resistance, so this is one of
the greatest challenges to all sides. Companies need to recognize the need
for change, and designers must think beyond design for its own sake and
attune their minds to the structure of the company and the needs of its
customers.</p>

    <p>Communication forms serve to send information in one direction only: from
the provider to the user. The provider creates the form, fills it with
information, and passes it on to the user, who reads the content and acts
accordingly. Examples are invoices, receipts, notices statements and
records</p>

<p>Dialogue forms go a step further. The provider creates a form with blank
spaces which is passed on to the user. This too is a kind of information,
since it is a request for the form to be filled in, the object being to
obtain information from the user in the manner specified by the form. The
user inserts the information, and returns it to the provider for
evaluation, thereby reversing the roles: the user becomes the sender, and
the provider becomes the receiver. Thus the form initiates a dialogue.
Examples of this type of form include applications, order forms and
questionnaires.</p>

<p>Internal forms include such items as time sheets, expenses forms and sick
notes. Their main function is organizational and they reflect internal
divisions of labour. External forms include applications, contracts and
invoices. They permit interaction and exchanges of information between
provider and user, and as well as being efficient tools of the trade, they
are also a means for providers to present themselves to the outside world.</p>

    <p>Wherever we go, forms go with us. Without them, there are no orders,
payments, deliveries, marriages, divorces, immigrations, emigrations, tax
declarations, arrest warrants or sick notes. They are there from the moment
we’re born, and we’re not even allowed to die without them. They bring
order, or at least form in the most literal sense, into our lives; they
promise clarity and direction, yet so often they cause helplessness, chaos
and confusion. A challenge to designers, they are sometimes sadly neglected
as they attempt to start a silent dialogue with the people who, frequently
put off by the very sight of them reluctantly have to fill them in.</p>

    <p>Consistency of image and behavior are the messages that should be conveyed
through corporate identity in all its aspects. If forms express this kind
of consistency, continuity, competence and seriousness they will build
trust in the company’s efficiency. For example, a business trying to sell
precision products needs to illustrate its precision in its forms, just as
a company offering simple solutions will gain its customer’s trust through
simple forms.</p>

<p>It is especially important that contractual forms convey an impression of
the utmost reliability. This, after all, is the trickiest moment in any
commercial relationship, and a frustrating form can undo all the preceding
efforts to build up a user’s trust and confidence.</p>

<p>Since forms organize and reflect internal structures, they are a good
indication of how credible a company’s corporate identity may be. Bad forms
can have dire consequences, because they provide tangible evidence that a
company’s image does not match its reality. To ensure that this image is
not merely skin deep, it should be promoted in all aspects of the company’s
activities, including the design of forms.</p>

    <p>In order for forms to fullfill their organizational role, their content and
design must fit in with the work procedures of the provider. However, this
is a two-way process, since procedures may also be influenced by forms, and
so herein lies one key to appropriate design: forms are always
simultaneously a mirror of internal organization and an instrument that can
change and/or optimize that organization.</p>

<p>Designing forms is therefore not just a matter of giving administrative
processes a visual form but changing the processes themselves. The two
actions cannot take place independently of each other, however. The aim is
always to produce forms that will facilitate effective interaction with
users and will create the best possible organizational structure for the
provider’s working practices. But since these are generally established
before the forms are created, the conditions required for successful
interaction, such as clarity and user friendliness, are often neglected.</p>
