    <p>I want to say one more thing about politics.</p>

<p>One of the legacies of the counterculture, particularly on the left, is the
idea that expression is action. This idea has haunted those of us on the
left for a long time.</p>

<p>But one of the reasons that the Tea Party came to power was that they
organized—they built institutions. So the challenge for those of us who
want a different world is not to simply trust that the expressive variety
that the internet permits is the key to freedom. Rather, we need to seek a
kind of freedom that involves people not like us, that builds institutions
that support people not like us—not just ones that help gratify our desires
to find new partners or build better micro-worlds.</p>

<p>The New Communalists believed that the micro-world was where politics
happened. If we could just build a better micro-world, we could live by
example to create a better world for the whole. I think that’s wrong. Our
challenge is to build a world that takes responsibility for people not like
ourselves. And it’s a challenge we won’t meet by enhancing our expressive
abilities, or improving the technologies of expressive connection.</p>
