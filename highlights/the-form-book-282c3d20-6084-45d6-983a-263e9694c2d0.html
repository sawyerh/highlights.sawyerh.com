    <p>Good design is not a panacea, and should not be merely cosmetic. Nothing is
more disheartening than a harmless, friendly-looking form whose content
turns out to be the direct opposite. The fact that tax return forms look so
complicated is primarily because the tax system is complicated, and paying
taxes can’t be made more pleasant just by making the forms look good.
Hiding things away or sprucing them up will not help, but a clearly
laid-out and easy-to-read design may at least soften the blow.</p>

<p>In a demanding context, form design has to cope with many obstacles. It
always reflects pre-existing structures, and in so doing it often brings to
light flaws that can only be rectified by reorganization. But changing
existing systems - personal, material or technical - is often very
expensive and is liable to meet with strong resistance, so this is one of
the greatest challenges to all sides. Companies need to recognize the need
for change, and designers must think beyond design for its own sake and
attune their minds to the structure of the company and the needs of its
customers.</p>
