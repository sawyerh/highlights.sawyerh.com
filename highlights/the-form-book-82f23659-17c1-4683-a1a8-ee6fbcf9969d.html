    <p>Consistency of image and behavior are the messages that should be conveyed
through corporate identity in all its aspects. If forms express this kind
of consistency, continuity, competence and seriousness they will build
trust in the company’s efficiency. For example, a business trying to sell
precision products needs to illustrate its precision in its forms, just as
a company offering simple solutions will gain its customer’s trust through
simple forms.</p>

<p>It is especially important that contractual forms convey an impression of
the utmost reliability. This, after all, is the trickiest moment in any
commercial relationship, and a frustrating form can undo all the preceding
efforts to build up a user’s trust and confidence.</p>

<p>Since forms organize and reflect internal structures, they are a good
indication of how credible a company’s corporate identity may be. Bad forms
can have dire consequences, because they provide tangible evidence that a
company’s image does not match its reality. To ensure that this image is
not merely skin deep, it should be promoted in all aspects of the company’s
activities, including the design of forms.</p>
